      <strong>Title of Research Study:</strong> Contextual Effects on Prominence Perception
    </p>
    <p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Jennifer Cole, Department of Linguistics</p>
    <p><strong>Student Investigator:</strong> Rebekah Stanhope</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Supported By:</strong> This research is supported by the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences
       and the Northwestern University Linguistics Department.

      <strong>Key information about this research study:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information
      that is more detailed is listed later on in this form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people perceive prosodic features of
      American English speech. You will be asked to make judgments about how prominent English words sound 
      (in other words, how much they stand out). We expect that you will be in this research study for about 15 minutes.
      There are no risks associated with participating in this study beyond what you experience from using a computer in everyday life.
      There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study, but this study may benefit society if the results lead to a
      better understanding of how people perceive speech.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</strong></p>
    <p>We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are a native speaker
       of American English and over 18 years old.</p>


    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>How many people will be in this study?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect about 30 people will be in this research study.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What should I know about participating in a research study?</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
      <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
      <li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
      <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
      <li>You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>What happens if I say, "Yes, I want to be in this research"?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The research study involves a single session which will last no longer than 30 minutes.
      You will participate remotely from a quiet location of your choice, using your computer and headphones.
      You will not directly interact with any member of the study team. You will be asked to listen to recordings
      of English sentences and make judgments about how prominent certain words are (in other words, how much 
      they stand out based on the way they sound).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Will being in this study help me in any way?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, this study may
      benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of how people perceive speech.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This study presents participants with no more than everyday risks. You are free to withdraw at any time, and data
      from participants who withdraw before completing the experiment will not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my
        mind later?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate.
      If you do not want to be in this study or you decide to withdraw from the study at any point,
      your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University. If you withdraw
      from the study, you will be paid for the portion you completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide to withdraw from this study, any data already collected from you will be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How will the researchers protect my information?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other
      researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you
      from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Who will have access to the information collected during this research
        study?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records,
      to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or
      after this study. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need
        access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>How might the information collected in this study be shared in the
        future?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for study recordkeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published,
      and with databases and data repositories used for research. We will remove or code any personal information that could directly
      identify you before the study data are shared. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the anonymity of your personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?</strong>
    </p>
